# Consort Foundation — Dogfood Result

**Date:** 2026-05-29 · **Branch:** `feat/foundation` · **Verdict:** ✅ PASS

The foundation sub-project's acceptance gate (Plan 03 Task 24): a live
`spawn → send → collect → roster → coda` against a real `codex` pane in tmux,
under an isolated `CONSORT_HOME=/tmp/consort-dogfood`.

## Run

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `soundcheck` | `Verdict: OK — ready to spawn (4/4 providers available; 0 warnings)` |
| `spawn violin codex dogfood-foundation` | pane `%20447`, border label `strings-violin:codex:dogfood-foundation`; emitted `{"event":"ready","ts":"…","instrument":"violin","model":"codex"}`; rc=0 |
| `send violin dogfood-foundation "…"` | inbox written (`From: maestro`) + pane nudged; rc=0 |
| `collect violin dogfood-foundation` | `{done}` received; rc=0 |
| `roster` | `violin  codex  dogfood-foundation  %20447  idle (done)` |
| `coda violin dogfood-foundation` | graceful FINE banner → one 9s wait → killNow → `archived violin-codex-20260529T063726Z`; rc=0 |

Full outbox sequence (the wire protocol, end-to-end):
```jsonl
{"event":"ready","ts":"2026-05-29T06:35:48Z","instrument":"violin","model":"codex"}
{"event":"ack","task_summary":"Report current working directory, then emit done event.","ts":"…"}
{"event":"progress","note":"/home/liupan/CC/consort","ts":"…"}
{"event":"done","summary":"Current working directory reported: /home/liupan/CC/consort","ts":"…"}
```

Post-teardown: part dir archived, topic dir `rmdir`'d, pane killed. The `instrument`
key (Tier-2 rename) is live in the emitted events.

## Notes / findings surfaced by the dogfood

- **soundcheck global-root bug** (fixed, commit `5182d21`): `soundcheck` copied config
  into `globalRoot()` before ensuring that directory existed (it only `stateEnsure()`'d
  the project root). Fixed to ensure the global config root early; regression test added.
- **codex 0.135.0 directory-trust prompt** (environment prerequisite, not a consort
  defect): codex gates first-run per repo with a trust picker that `--dangerously-bypass-
  approvals-and-sandbox` does not cover. The spawn mechanics (pane split, launch, nudge,
  ready-poll, and on the first attempt the timeout → `failure-reason.txt` → `…-FAILED`
  archive → exit 1) all worked correctly; `{ready}` arrived once `/home/liupan/CC/consort`
  was added to codex's trusted projects.

## Verification context

- 102 vitest unit tests green; `tsc --noEmit` + eslint clean; stale-token gate clean.
- 12-agent adversarial verification vs. clone-wars caught + fixed a real event-precedence
  bug in `outboxWait` (commit `cc6dc6d`: events resolve in argument order, not file order).
